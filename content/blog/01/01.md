Description = "Reverse proxies are a staple of self-hosting and there are many different options available. We have chosen to use the SWAG approach from (LSIO)[linuxserver.io] and it has worked well for a long time. BUT, there are times when you don't want all your containers on a single YAML file and still need SWAG to direct traffic to the isolated container. How do you get this to play nicely together? Well, let's get cautiously curious and find out!"

## How is SWAG Traditionally Used?

In the past, we have put all of our containers onto a single `docker-compose.yml` file. This approach is recommended by the LSIO team and makes using their SWAG proxy and other containers super easy. In the SWAG documentation, it is pretty easy to gloss over a tiny detail about a user defined bridge[^1] and if you are an inexperienced user who doesn't know the gritty details about Docker, the official documentation[^2] that LSIO links too can make a user's eyes glaze over as they are overwhelmed with information that, in my opinion, isn't super relevant to the direct issue of **HOW** to apply a user defined network to specific compose files. 

From looking at LSIO compose files for years, I think there is a disconnect between what is recommended in the documentation and what is shown in the example compose files. Now, I maybe wrong, I am NOT a dev or an experienced Docker person, but based on some other Docker documentation that I found[^3], I think this is a cleaner example of how to actually apply a user defined network to a compose file.

## What Lead to the Issue?
The whole reason this became an issue for me personally is that I wanted to use the container version of [Azuracast](https://docs.azuracast.com/en/getting-started/installation/docker), a self-hosted internet radio station, and part of the requirement is that the compose files and volumes are stored and kept in `/var/azuracast`. This meant that I could not place them on the same compose file and Azuracast uses it's own way of installing things with "magic scripts" so it would get very complicated very quickly.

Initially, after reading websites, forum posts and discussion in the LSIO [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/YWrKVTn) I had created a network called `swag` and added it to Azuracast as shown below.
```
services:
    web:
        container_name: azuracast
        image: 'azuracast.docker.scarf.sh/azuracast/azuracast:${AZURACAST_VERSION:-latest}'

            - '8005:8005'
            - '8006:8006'
        env_file: azuracast.env
        environment:

            NGINX_WEBDJ_PORTS: (8005)

            - 'www_uploads:/var/azuracast/uploads'
            - 'station_data:/var/azuracast/stations'
            - 'shoutcast2_install:/var/azuracast/servers/shoutcast2'

            - 'backups:/var/azuracast/backups'
            - 'acme:/var/azuracast/acme'
            - 'db_data:/var/lib/mysql'
        restart: unless-stopped
        ulimits:
            nofile:
                soft: 65536
                hard: 65536
        logging:
            options:
                max-size: 1m
                max-file: '5'
volumes:
    db_data: {  }
    acme: {  }
    shoutcast2_install: {  }
    stereo_tool_install: {  }
    geolite_install: {  }
    sftpgo_data: {  }
    station_data: {  }
    www_uploads: {  }
    backups: {  }
networks:
  default:
    name: swag
    external: true

```

The most important part of that is the `networks` section at the very end. I could use the command `docker inspect azuracast` to see that it was on the correct network. Even though it showed that the container was on the correct network, I couldn't reach it with a proxy through Swag. I eventually found out that a better command to use was `docker inspect network swag` because it will show all the **containers on the network** rather than just what network a specific container is attached to, like the first command did with Azuracast.

When I used the `docker network inspect` command, I saw that none of the containers on my main compose file were connected to the network. Using ` docker network ls` I was able to see that there was my `swag` network, but also a network with the name of my host machine, as an example `computerName_default`.

This is when things started to click for me and I understand now what the documentation was trying to get across. 
* If the user does not define a network in the main compose file, a default network is created.
* This default created network **CANNOT** connect to containers outside of the network based on dns using container names, which is how Swag functions.
* The default network needed to be removed and the user defined `swag` network needed to be added to the main compose file.

## Adding a User Defined network to a Multi-Container Compose File

Now that I knew what I needed to do, I had to figure out the *right* way of doing it. My main compose file has about six containers on it and I wasn't sure if I had to added the `networks` section to each of them with all the information of 
```
  default:
    name: swag
    external: true
```
Or if I needed to just add something like this to show that it should *depend* or *connect* to the user defined network.
```
        networks:
            - swag
```

The answer for an experienced Docker user may seem obvious but to someone who just plays around, it can be a troublesome step to figure out. After trying various combinations, the answer was just to include the network definition once at the end of the compose file.

Having the `networks` information at the end, applied the setting to all containers above which makes sense to me now because if no network is defined, all containers go onto the default and *if* a network is defined, all containers go onto the defined network.
